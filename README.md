# Bachelor's Thesis
This repository contains both the LaTeX file as well as the implementation of the [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com) and [Angular](https://angular.io) demo applications which are the core of my bachelor's thesis **Comparison of the Single-page Application Frameworks Vaadin and Angular**.

*Please note:* This thesis is written in German. To get an overview of the content of the paper, please have a look at the abstract below.

## Abstract
An increasing number of web applications and apps are being implemented using the SPA approach. A large number of frameworks are available for the implementation of such an application, which also offer additional functionali- ties. SPAs can be implemented not only with JavaScript, but also with Java- based solutions. However, the different approaches and technology stacks have certain advantages, disadvantages and pitfalls. This thesis therefore compares the JavaScript/TypeScript framework Angular with the Java-based framework Vaadin.

In addition to the intended comparison and the subsequent results, the cur- rent state of the art is highlighted. The approach of SPAs is compared to that of MPAs and the functioning of Vaadin Flow is examined in more detail. Whe- re appropriate, the approach of Angular is also considered and brought into context with the implementation of Vaadin.

In order to narrow down the comparison and to set a focus, three criteria were defined on the basis of which the planning, implementation and final eva- luation of the developed demo applications were carried out. In addition to the possibility of easily implementing a PWA, attention was paid to the reusability of components as well as the local and server-side data handling. Based on two different user stories that combine these criteria, two applications were develo- ped that were used for the final evaluation and the resulting recommendations.

The goal of this thesis, creating a well-founded comparison between Vaadin and Angular, has been fulfilled. Although it is not possible to express a general recommendation for one of the two frameworks, specific recommendations can be made for both Vaadin and Angular on the basis of various scenarios that are based on the criteria mentioned above.
