	abstract = {SummaryIn Single Page Web Applications you'll learn to build modern browser-based apps that take advantage of stronger client platforms and more predictable bandwidth. You'll learn the SPA design approach, and then start exploring new techniques like structured JavaScript and responsive design. And you'll learn how to capitalize on trends like server-side JavaScript and NoSQL data stores, as well as new frameworks that make JavaScript more manageable and testable as a first-class language.About this BookIf your website is a jumpy collection of linked pages, you are behind. Single page web applications are your next step: pushing UI rendering and business logic to the browser and communicating with the server only to synchronize data, they provide a smooth user experience, much like a native application. But, SPAs can be hard to develop, manage, and test.Single Page Web Applications shows how your team can easily design, test, maintain, and extend sophisticated SPAs using JavaScript end-to-end, without getting locked into a framework. Along the way, you'll develop advanced HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills, and use JavaScript as the language of the web server and the database.This book assumes basic knowledge of web development. No experience with SPAs is required.Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.What's InsideDesign, build, and test a full-stack SPABest-in-class tools like jQuery, TaffyDB, Node.js, and MongoDBReal-time web with web sockets and Socket.IOTouch controls for tablets and smartphonesCommon SPA design mistakesAbout the AuthorsThe authors are architects and engineering managers.
